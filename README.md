# Simple Keylogger Tool ‚å®Ô∏è  

A simple Python-based keylogger that records keystrokes and saves them to a file. Built using the `pynput` library, this tool is designed for **educational purposes only** and emphasizes the importance of ethical use and explicit permissions.  

---

## üöÄ Features  

- **Logs keystrokes** including regular keys, spaces, and special keys like `Enter`, `Tab`, and `Backspace`.  
- **Saves logs** to a file (`keystrokes.log`) for easy review.  
- **Stops logging** when the `ESC` key is pressed.  
- Lightweight and easy to use for learning purposes.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Library:** `pynput` (for keyboard input monitoring)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation  

### Prerequisites  

- Python 3.x or higher  
- `pynput` library  

### Steps to Run  

1. Clone the repository:  

    ```bash  
    git clone https://github.com/KashifMalik777/PRODIGY_CS_04.git  
    ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory:  

    ```bash  
    cd PRODIGY_CS_04-main  
    ```  

3. Install the required Python package:  

    ```bash  
    pip install pynput  
    ```  

4. Run the keylogger script:  

    ```bash  
    python keylogger.py  
    ```  

5. Press `ESC` to stop the keylogger. Logs will be saved in `keystrokes.log`.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage  

1. Run the script as described above.  
2. The keylogger will start recording keystrokes.  
3. Press the `ESC` key to stop logging.  
4. Review the logged keystrokes in the `keystrokes.log` file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Considerations  

- **Always obtain explicit written consent** before using this tool on any device.  
- **Do not use this tool for malicious purposes.** Unauthorized monitoring is illegal and unethical.  
- This tool is intended solely for educational purposes and ethical security testing.

## üìñ How It Works  

The keylogger uses the `pynput` library to monitor keyboard inputs. It captures:  
- Regular keys (e.g., letters, numbers).  
- Special keys (e.g., `Enter`, `Tab`, `Backspace`).  
- Formats and saves the keystrokes to a log file.

## üé® Demo  

Here‚Äôs a quick preview of how the keylogger works:  

1. Run the script.  
2. Type some text:  
    ```  
    Hello, World!  
    ```  
3. Press `ESC` to stop.  
4. Check `keystrokes.log`:  
    ```  
    Hello, World!  
    ```
